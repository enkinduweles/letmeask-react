# Let me Ask

> This project was made during the **NLW - TOGETHER** by **Rocketseat**.

It's a Q&A (e.g. for use during a live section), allowing visitors to make question and mark as liked to let the owner's room knows the most relevant doubt of the visitors, this way, create an interactivity owner - visitor focused on to ask common doubts during a period of time available by the owner's room.

You can create a room providing an authentication method (e.g. it was used google auth) and share the room code for people access and ask questions.
